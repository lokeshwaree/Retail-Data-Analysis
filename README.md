Retail data encompasses a wide range of information essential for managing and optimizing retail operations. It includes detailed product information such as product ID, name, category, pricing, discounts, and supplier details. Sales data is another critical component, capturing transaction details like the date, time, quantity sold, and total sales amount, often linked to specific customer profiles that provide insights into demographics, purchase history, and preferences. Inventory data tracks stock levels, warehouse locations, and stock movements, ensuring that the right products are available at the right time. Additionally, retail data often includes customer ratings and reviews, which provide valuable feedback on products, and return data, which details product returns, reasons for returns, return rates, and associated policies. Analyzing this data helps retailers better understand customer behavior, optimize inventory management, improve sales strategies, and ultimately enhance the overall customer experience.
